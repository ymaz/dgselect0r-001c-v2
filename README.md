## How to run


Please run the following (in the root of the repo):

1. *Dev mode*:

```console
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. For the *Production mode*: 

```console
nvm use
npm install
npm run prod
```

3. Run unit tests:

```console
nvm use
npm install
npm run test:run
```

4. Enjoy!

`nvm use` is optional, but nice to have in order to make sure we are running on expected Node version.

*Note:* Unit tests have been added outside of allocated hours for this task.
