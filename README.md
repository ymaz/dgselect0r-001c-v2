## How to run


Please run the following (in the root of the repo):

1. *Dev mode*:

```console
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. For the *Production mode*: 

```console
nvm use
npm install
npm run prod
```

`nvm use` is optional, but nice to have in order to make sure we are running on expected Node version.
